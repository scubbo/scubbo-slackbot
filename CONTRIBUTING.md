Pull requests very welcome indeed!

Things to know:
* This is a fun side-project that I set up to teach myself about
    Cloudformation, Slack API, and Lambda. My Python knowledge
    is all self-taught, and I probably have a bunch of bad habits
    or gaps in my knowledge. Please feel free to suggest better
    ways to do anything!
* Deployment is via a CodePipeline on my AWS Account. Sadly,
    I don't yet have a staging server setup, nor any notification
    of deployments.
* ...I'll add more here as I think of things!
